## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS)

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.

This repository contains source code for visualization and analysis for smart metering data collected by researchers at Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University.
